# LaTeX-Basics---Workshop (EN)
This repository contains the sample files used in the LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session Workshop (90 minutes).

## Brief description of the LaTeX-Basics---Workshop (EN) 
In this workshop, a document is created in which specific LaTeX topics (according to contents below) can be practiced. The document will be created/edited with the self-installed LaTeX environment on the own laptop or with the online editor Overleaf. The workshop is structured in such a way that individual topics (according to contents below) can be worked on independently with the help of a manual. Thus, participants have the opportunity to create a LaTeX template tailored to their needs.
