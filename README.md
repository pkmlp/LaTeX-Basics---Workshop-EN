# LaTeX-Basics---Workshop (EN)
This repository contains the sample files used in the LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session Workshop (90 minutes).

## Brief description of the LaTeX-Basics---Workshop (EN) 
Usually, texts are created with a word processing package (OpenOffice, LibreOffice or Microsoft Office). However, for professional and/or very large documents (especially in the mathematical-technical area) the possibilities of such standard Office packages are not sufficient. LaTeX is a text typesetting system that meets these requirements. Those who are used to a word processor will find the introduction to LaTeX very hard to get used to. Creating documents with LaTeX is closer to programming with a page description language than to entering text with standard WYSIWYG office packages. In this basic session, a first overview of LaTeX, the features of LaTeX and the required components will be given. A first small LaTeX document will be created with the online LaTeX editor Overleaf (the easy to use, online, collaborative LaTeX editor).

## Target audience of the LaTeX-Basics---Workshop (EN) 
The LaTeX Basics - Lunch Session is intended for students who have no previous experience with LaTeX. Students who have already created a document with LaTeX will not learn anything new. We recommend that they attend the LaTeX-Basics - Workshop, which can now also be attended without completing the Lunch Session.
